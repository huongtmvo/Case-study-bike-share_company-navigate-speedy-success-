This is the case study for Cyclistic, a bike_sharing company
* Import and merge the latest 12 months data of Cyclistic's trips 
* Perform data wrangling using Pandas, Numpy
* Perform data analysis using Python
* Create different data visualization using Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Derive insights into how annual members are different from casual members.
* Recommendation for the marketing team to attract more casual riders to convert to annual membership.

## I. Introduction¶
### Scenario
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Since annual members are more profitable than casual riders, the marketing director Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## II. Business task:
This project aims at answering the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? Answering this question will provide insights for the team to better understand the customers and how to create an effective marketing program.

## III. Data wrangling and analysis:
This project uses the latest 12 months data of Cyclistic's trips from Motivate International Inc. The data is suitable for the project and is reliable, coming from a reputable source.
We perform different data wrangling methods to ensure the integrity of the data and data analysis to learn some data insights.

## Iv. Findings
* Cyclistic riders compose of 54% annual members and 46% of casual riders.
* Among the three types of bikes, members users use more classic and eletric bikes while casual members use more docked bikes.
* During everyday of the week,the amount of time per trip of members are shorter than casual riders, with the average members ride the bike for about 13-16 minutes and the casual riders ride the bike for 28-38 minutes on average.
* Member users are more active during Monday to Friday; whereas casual riders ride more on the weekends.
* Summer months from June to August have the most rides. Casual rides are more than member rides in June, July and August.Compared to the members, casual riders' number of rides varies more widely.
* From the result above, we can see that the majority of start and end locations for casual riders are at Streeter De & Grand Ave, Millenium Park and Michigan Ave & Oak st while the members's start and end location are more spread out.

## V.Recommendations
Most of the differences in the uses of member and casual riders can be explained their use purposes. Members are more likely to use the bikes for work, with convenient and dispersed locations, shorter rides, and are more active during work week. On the contrary, casual riders are more likely to use the bike for leisure, with longer average rides, mostly on weekends and in the summer months when weather is nice.
If the company wants to convert casual riders to members, we can market the convenience of our service for work not just leisure, such as the amount of time saved because of our many dispersed staions. An additional idea might be to give a discount to attract the leisure riders to convert to our full membership.
In order to help with figuring out the best marketing plan, ddditional research must be done on why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
